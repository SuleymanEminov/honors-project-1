# teacher-contacts
I had to collect names and emails of teachers in five schools for my first Honors Project. This is the script that automated this task. I used selenium API for web scraping, and pandas for data manipulation. As an output, the code would create a new excel sheet and write all the data there. 

For my first Honors Project, I did a survey for school teachers asking to evaluate a training that they recieved in summer. Other than that, I asked if they are interested in attending training if SUNY JCC's Workforce Readiness offered an efficient program specifically designed for school teachers.
